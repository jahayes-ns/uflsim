Description: neural simulator
 This program is a re-implementation of Ronald J. MacGregorâ€™s SYSTM11
 simulator as documented in his 1987 book Neural and Brain Modeling,
 together with the NEWSNED network editor and the SNEDSKOP waveform
 display program.  NEWSNED enables the user to generate the network
 model with a graphical display of the cell populations and the
 synaptic connections, and to launch the simulator.  SNEDSKOP displays
 the simulation results, which are also available as a .bdt file.  The
 simulator also includes a mechanical model of the respiratory system,
 which can be integrated with the neural model.
 The usfsim package is an upgrade of the USF simulator package. The Motif-based
 user interface was replaced with the Qt framework. The workflow has also been
 completely overhauled. Some rarely used features of the simulator package have
 been removed.
