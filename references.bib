abstract ={Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the thorax with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and functional quantification was evaluated as a tool for structure-function evaluation of chest-wall mechanics. Good agreement was found between the corresponding spirometric and MR imaging values of lung volumes. Fast MR imaging of the thorax with 3D reconstruction should improve the ability to evaluate the inspiratory pump in clinical and research investigations.},

abstract ={The changes produced by body posture on total lung capacity and its subdivisions have been reported for all positions except the prone position. Twenty normal subjects, twelve males and eight females, had determinations of total lung capacity in the three body positions, sitting, supine and prone. Tidal volume, minute ventilation and O2 consumption were also measured. The changes found on assumption of the supine position from the sitting position were similar to those previously reported. For the prone position, a smaller inspiratory capacity and a larger expiratory reserve volume were found. The mean values were changed, respectively, –8% and +37%. Associated with these changes was a significant increase of the functional residual capacity by 636 ml. Ventilation did not change significantly from that found during sitting, unlike the findings associated with the supine position, in which position the tidal volume was decreased. Respiratory frequency remained the same for all positions.Submitted on April 5, 1960},

abstract ={The static pressure-volume characteristics of the lungs were determined in 28 normal males between the ages of 21 and 76 years. Transpulmonary pressures were measured in relation to absolute lung volumes throughout the entire range of the vital capacity, both on inspiration and expiration. There was an increase in residual volume and a decrease in vital capacity, but no change in the slope or position of the pressure-volume curve with advancing age. It appeared that the older subjects were unable to change transpulmonary pressure between residual volume and total lung capacity to the same extent as the younger subjects. The results suggest that with advancing age there is little change in the intrinsic static pressure-volume characteristics of the lungs themselves, and that all of the significant changes with age are more likely due to changes in either the compliance or muscle power of the thorax.Submitted on December 24, 1959},

abstract="The influence of age and posture on compliance of the rib cage (Crc) and diaphragm-abdomen (Cab) compartments of the chest wall was studied in 61 healthy adults (33 men, 28 women) aged 24-75 yr. Chest wall compliance (Cw) was measured by the weighted spirometer technique; Crc and Cab were derived from the slope of the relaxation line of the thoracoabdominal system obtained with two pairs of linearized magnetometers. While Cw was being measured, we monitored electrical activity of the abdominal external oblique muscle with a concentric needle electrode and thoracoabdominal configuration. In 52 subjects, the electromyogram did not show any abdominal muscle activity and the end-expiratory level never departed from the relaxed thoracoabdominal configuration, thus suggesting adequate respiratory muscle relaxation. Aging was associated with significant decreases in Crc and Cab. In the upright posture Crc decreased from 0.164 +/- 0.041 (mean +/- SD) l/cmH2O in the younger subjects (24-39 yr) to 0.114 +/- 0.027 l/cmH2O in the older subjects (55-75 yr). Cab concomitantly fell from 0.032 +/- 0.012 l/cmH2O to 0.020 +/- 0.007 l/cmH2O. These reductions were statistically significant (P less than 0.05-0.01) and were also present in the supine posture. Shifting from the seated to the supine posture did not cause any significant change in Cw but was invariably associated with a decrease in Crc and an increase in Cab.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Experiments were conducted on 111 muscle bundles obtained from 18 mongrel dogs. Segments of costal diaphragm, parasternal intercostal, scalene, sternomastoid, triangularis sterni, rectus abdominis, external oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles were studied. We noted a linear relationship between the distance measured between two fixed points in excised bundles (Lex) and at the muscles' Lo. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.83 (P less than 0.01) for the transversus abdominis to 0.92 (P less than 0.01) for the triangularis sterni and external oblique muscles. Pooled Lex for all muscles averaged 61.4 +/- 6.3\% (SD) Lo, with specific values ranging from 55.5 +/- 3.9\% Lo for triangularis sterni bundles to 63.0 +/- 5.1\% Lo for external oblique bundles. In three additional dogs, we verified the usefulness of this relationship and prospectively estimated Lo from excised length in 10 costal diaphragm bundles and 10 transversus abdominis bundles and then measured Lo directly. Predicted Lo averaged 100.0 +/- 6.0\% Lo for diaphragm and 97.6 +/- 5.9\% Lo for transversus abdominis muscle. We conclude that Lo can be conveniently and accurately estimated from excised dimensions. This rapid estimation technique should prove valuable for future studies in respiratory muscle physiology.",

Average lung compliance was 0.21 in sitting, 0.19 in lateral and 0.16 L.cm H2O-1 in supine positions. The change was significant (p less than 0.01) between sitting and supine position. Flow-resistance increased from 1.78 in sitting to 2.5 cm H2O.L-1.s (p less than 0.001) in lateral positions, and did not increase further in the supine posture in spite of a 35 percent decrease in ERV (p less than 0.001). Since it is known that lower airways resistance increases with decreasing lung volume, the lack of change in flow-resistance when shifting from lateral to supine posture suggests that upper airways flow-resistance (larynx and oropharynx) is greater in the lateral decubitus than in the supine positions. The decrease of lung compliance in horizontal postures probably reflects increased pulmonary blood volume and small airways closure.",

abstract ={We used a high-resolution ultrasound to make electrical recordings from the transversus abdominis muscle in humans. The behavior of this muscle was then compared with that of the external oblique and rectus abdominis in six normal subjects in the seated posture. During voluntary efforts such as expiration from functional residual capacity, speaking, expulsive maneuvers, and isovolume “belly-in” maneuvers, the transversus in general contracted together with the external oblique and the rectus abdominis. In contrast, during hyperoxic hypercapnia, all subjects had phasic expiratory activity in the transversus at ventilations between 10 and 18 l/min, well before activity could be recorded from either the external oblique or the rectus abdominis. Similarly, inspiratory elastic loading evoked transversus expiratory activity in all subjects but external oblique activity in only one subject and rectus abdominis activity in only two subjects. We thus conclude that in humans 1) the transversus abdominis is recruited preferentially to the superficial muscle layer of the abdominal wall during breathing and 2) the threshold for abdominal muscle recruitment during expiration is substantially lower than conventionally thought.},

abstract ={Measurement of the pressure required to produce volume acceleration of the lungs and gas stream was made in five human subjects. In three, measurements were made at increased ambient pressures. Transpulmonary pressure was recorded as the pressure difference between mouth and esophagus. The accelerative component of the transpulmonary pressure change between instants of zero air flow at the extremes of the tidal volume was obtained by subtraction of the estimated elastic component from the total pressure change. In order to increase the accelerative pressures, measurements were made during rapid, shallow breathing. The ratio of the accelerative pressure change to the simultaneous change in volume acceleration, expressed the “inertance” of the lungs and gas stream. At atmospheric pressure (ca. 15 psi) approximately 0.01 cm H2O was required to produce a volume acceleration of 1 l/sec.2 Inertance increased approximately in proportion to ambient pressure up to 4 atmospheres absolute pressure. It was concluded that the inertance, as measured, was predominantly in the gas stream. An estimate of the inertance of the gas stream, based on the anatomy of the respiratory tree, was found to be of the same order of magnitude as the observed values.Submitted on March 14, 1956},

abstract ={A model for the conversion of respiratory neural output to mechanical output, and vice versa, is described. Neural output was expressed in terms of isometric pressure generated at passive functional residual capacity. The mechanical response time constant of respiratory muscle was assumed to be 0.06 s. The effect of volume and configuration on pressure output was modeled after the data of Grassino et al. (J. Appl. Physiol.: Respirat. Environ. Exercise Physiol. 44: 829–839, 1978). Equations were developed to examine the effect of different configurational pathways during inspiration. We utilized Hill's hyperbolic force-velocity relation to model the effect of flow on pressure output. The pressure asymptote of the hyperbola was considered to be similar to that in other skeletal muscles (0.25 isometric pressure). The flow asymptote was derived from data obtained during maximal voluntary inspiration. A major feature of the model is the dependence of volume, configuration, and flow-related pressure losses on level of inspiratory activity. The practical effect of potential errors and the overall accuracy of the model are presented in the two succeeding communications.},

abstract ={Diaphragmatic volume displacements cause equal displacements of abdominal contents. Since the rib cage forms a variable part of the abdominal container (the variable part being its area of apposition with the diaphragm) the rib cage and ventral abdominal wall share in abdominal displacements. The fraction of total rib cage volume displacement (delta Vrc) contributing to abdominal displacement is predicted from anatomic considerations and measurements. During quiet inspirations it is estimated that more than half of delta Vrc goes into abdominal expansion. This displacement plus the outward displacement of the anterolateral abdominal wall constitute the diaphragmatic displacement. In a typical inspiration in which delta Vrc accounts for 3/4 of the lung volume change, the diaphragm displaces nearly the same volume. Associated changes in diaphragm length are estimated with a model. Diaphragm shortening during an inspiration in which only the rib cage expands is estimated to be only 11% less than during a normal inspiration. We conclude that the direct rib cage contribution to lung volume change is much less, and that diaphragmatic contribution is much more than was previously thought.},

The diaphragm was assumed to contract isometrically when subjects performed inspiratory efforts against a closed airway at specified abdominothoracic configurations, increasing Edi and Pdi while holding lung volume and rib case and abdominal AP diameters constant. The relationship between Pdi and Edi depends primarily on abdominothoracic configuration rather than lung volume. For equal increments in lung volume, the Pdi developed at constant Edi is four to eight times more sensitive to changes in abdominal than in rib cage AP diameter. We demonstrate an isofunctional state of the diaphragm at different lung volumes, when increases in lung volume and rib cage AP diameter are compensated for by slight decreases in abdominal AP diameter, resulting in a constant relationship between Edi and Pdi. We conclude that diaphragm shortening is reflected more directly in abdominal displacement than in lung volume change.},

abstract ={We measured separate volume-pressure (V-P) relationships or rib cage anddiaphragm-abdomen in seven human subjects during voluntary relaxation of the respiratory muscles, breathing at rest, during exercise, and rebreathingexpired air. Estimates of separate volume displacements of the two parallelchest wall pathways were based on analysis of rib cage and abdominal anteroposterior diameter changes. The pressure developed across each pathway (transthoracic pressure) was partitioned into two serial pressure drops: transdiaphragmatic pressure and transabdominal pressure. We develop the concept that the relationship of volume displacements of structures to pressures developed by the structures during breathing, as compared to the relaxed state,reflects action of respiratory muscles in the structure. We interpret therelationship of rib cage volume displacements to transabdominal pressure(during breathing vs. relaxation) as indicating action of intercostal and accessory muscles only, the separate action of diaphragm on rib cage being measured by transdiaphragmatic pressure. At rest, the diaphragm is the only importantly active respiratory muscle. During increased ventilation activityofother respiratory muscles appears coordinated to assist the optimize diaphragmatic function.},

year = {1978}, 
abstract ={We tested the hypothesis that the inspiratory pressure swings across the rib-cage pathway are the sum of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) and the pressures developed by the intercostal/accessory muscles (Pic). If correct, Pic can only contribute to lowering pleural pressure (Ppl), to the extent that it lowers abdominal pressure (Pab). To test this we measured Pab and Ppl during during Mueller maneuvers in which deltaPab = 0. Because there was no outward displacement of the rib cage, Pic must have contributed to deltaPpl, as did Pdi. Under these conditions the total pressure developed by the inspiratory muscles across the rib-cage pathway was less than Pdi + Pic. Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis. A plot of Pab vs. Ppl during relaxation allows partitioning of the diaphragmatic and intercostal/accessory muscle contributions to inspiratory pressure swings. The analysis indicates that the diaphragm can act both as a fixator, preventing transmission of Ppl to the abdomen and as an agonist. When abdominal muscles remain relaxed it only assumes the latter role to the extent that Pab increases.},

year = {1992}, 
abstract ={We analyzed three different assumptions about diaphragm function that determine the thoracoabdominal interaction. In the simplest case, the diaphragm is assumed to be a completely flaccid membrane serving only to partition the thorax and the abdominal cavity. In the second case, it is assumed to have a finite tension but to maintain a relatively flat surface at the base of the rib cage (i.e., a negligible zone of apposition). In the general case, it is assumed that the diaphragm has finite tension and its position may vary (i.e., permitting a zone of apposition). These possible modes of behavior are incorporated into a mathematical model of ventilatory system mechanics that distinguishes the diaphragm, lung, abdomen, and rib cage. The significance of these modes is examined with respect to data from human experiments in which gas or liquid is introduced into the pleural or abdominal spaces, causing a volume change (Vep). We show that the Vep effect on the thoracic and abdominal volumes is sensitive to diaphragm mechanics and depends on the nature of the Vep: gastric distension (with water or air) or pneumothorax. Only the behavior of the general model is consistent with physiological observations, especially the distribution of Vep. Our general mathematical model can quantitatively predict this behavior.},

abstract ={1. Transnasal pressure (delta p) in Pa and gas flow in cm3 s-1 were measured in men breathing gases of different density, assuming flow through each nostril (f) to be half the measured total flow. Measurements were also made in children with allergic rhinitis before and after nasal antigen challenge. 2. Flow always showed evidence of turbulence when transnasal pressure exceeded 40-80 Pa breathing air and Reynolds number exceeded 2400 (1800 in the presence of nasal obstruction). 3. Changes in effective mean nasal airway diameter (D) after nasal challenge can be determined at points of similar pressure from the relation log (D2/D1) = 0.368 log (f2/f1) when flow is turbulent. 4. Absolute estimates of airway diameter in cm can be obtained from the relation 4.75 log D = 1.75 log f--log delta p+log L--4.756 breathing air when flow is turbulent (since the relation between pressure and flow approximates to that found in a long cylinder) and these estimates are only marginally affected by differing assumptions about nasal airway length (L). 5. Because pressure and flow are non-linearly related, and changing nasal dimensions have a profound effect on the flow at which turbulence occurs, it is suggested that measures of nasal conductance at delta p greater than or equal to 0.1 kPa are preferable to the more conventional measures of nasal resistance at a specified flow rate.},

Assuming a normative range that encompasses three standard deviations from the mean or 99.7% of the normal population, the upper limits of normal for coronal and sagittal diameters, respectively, in men aged 20-79, are 25 mm and 27 mm; in women, they are 21 mm and 23 mm, respectively. The lower limit of normal for both dimensions is 13 mm in men and 10 mm in women. Deviation from these figures reflects pathologic widening or narrowing of the tracheal air column.

Both measurements were performed in the supine position during tidal breathing at functional residual capacity. We found excellent agreement in glottic areas obtained by both methods: the mean (+/- SD) values were 1.8 +/- 0.8 cm2 for the acoustic method and 1.7 +/- 0.9 cm2 for the CT method. Linear regression analysis revealed the following relationship between the area measured by acoustic technique (AAC) and that measured by CT (ACT): AAC = 0.81.ACT + 0.36. There was a significant correlation between the two measurements of glottic area (r = 0.95, P less than 0.0001).

abstract ={We examined the movements of the vocal cords during tidal breathing, panting, and large changes in lung volume in 12 normal subjects. The glottis was observed with a fiber-optic bronchoscope, and the glottic image was recorded together with flow, volume, and a time marker onto videotape. Phasic respiratory swings in glottic width (dg) and glottic area (Ag) were reproducible in all subjects but differed substantially between subjects. In the group as a whole dg and Ag increased during inspiration to 10.1 +/- 5.6 mm and 126 +/- 8 mm2 (mean +/- SE), respectively, whereas during expiration the lowest values were 5.7 +/- 0.5 mm and 70 +/- 7 mm2, respectively. These extreme dimensions corresponded closely to the midtidal volume points in the respiratory cycle. Glottic width during vital capacity (VC) expirations was nearly 30% greater at a flow of 1.2 l/s than at 0.5 l/s, but the relationship between dg and lung volume differed between subjects. When swings in dg were minimized by panting, there was no difference in dg between functional residual capacity (FRC) and a volume corresponding to midinspiratory capacity. However, tidal breathing at this lung volume was associated with a 20% decrease in dg compared with breathing at FRC. Our observations indicate a tight coupling between the pattern of glottic movement and the respiratory volume cycle. The results suggest that during voluntary respiratory maneuvers both intrinsic laryngeal and respiratory muscles are recruited, participating as effector organs in ventilatory and respiratory control.},

abstract ={We examined the relationship between subglottic pressure (P), flow (V), and thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle activity in six anesthetized tracheostomized dogs while a constant flow (0.05-1.2 l/s) of warmed humidified air was passed through the upper airway in an expiratory direction. The TA activity was recorded by fine bipolar wire electrodes and was reflexly altered by changes in lung volume and chest wall compression. The integrated muscle activity was expressed as a percentage of a maximal peak integrated TA activity (%max). In the absence of TA activity the pressure-flow relationship was alinear and could be described by a power function. Log-log P-V plots at varying levels of TA activity were linear, with a slope a of 1.84 +/- 0.07 (SD). When TA activity increased, laryngeal resistance increased exponentially. An effective hydraulic diameter was calculated for increments in %max TA and decreased linearly with %max TA. In three dogs the glottic diameter was computed from glottic area measured by fiber-optic laryngoscopy, and it also decreased linearly as TA increased. Sectioning of the external motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve to the cricothyroid muscle demonstrated no consistent effect on laryngeal resistance over a range of TA activity. The results indicate that laryngeal dimensions decrease linearly with TA activity. However, the P-V relationship of the larynx may be described by a power function, with a single exponent consistent with an orifice flow regimen. Spontaneous activity of the cricothyroid muscle does not measurably influence this relationship.},

The PCA activity was recorded using bipolar fine-wire electrodes, expressed as a percentage of the quiet breathing level and altered by mechanical ventilation, changes in lung volume, and chest wall compression. Subglottic pressure was recorded while a constant flow of air was passed through the upper airway. In the absence of PCA activity the PV relationship was alinear and could be described by a power function (P = K0Va, where K0 and a are constants). The slope of the log P-log V plots in the absence of PCA and thyroarytenoid activity was 1.83 +/- 0.02 (SD), whereas with increasing PCA activity it was 1.88 +/- 0.11. An effective hydraulic diameter (DH) was calculated for 20% increments of PCA activity, and in two dogs glottic diameter (Dg) was calculated from glottic area measurements obtained by fiber-optic laryngoscopy. Both DH and Dg increased linearly with increasing PCA activity. Denervation of the cricothyroid muscle had no systematic effect on laryngeal resistance. The results indicate that the PV relationship of the larynx may be described by a power function with a single exponent, the magnitude of which is independent of glottic dilator muscle activity and consistent with orifice flow.

abstract ={In the preceding communication we developed a model for the conversion of neural output to mechanical output. We were left with two qualitative uncertainties, namely, the relation between neural output and isometric pressure, and the behavior of inspiratory muscles during expiratory flow; and two quantitative uncertainties concerning the effect of configurational pathway on pressure output, and the slope of the pressure-flow relation. For each of the above uncertainties we made certain assumptions based on indirect evidence but defined reasonable error limits. In the present communication we describe the method of implementing the model and evaluate the significance, in terms of spirometric output, of possible errors in the assumptions. Volume and flow profiles were generated from different neural output profiles. Analysis was repeated when the different assumptions were systematically altered within the limits set by the previous theoretical analysis. We conclude that the pattern of inspiratory muscle activation during spontaneous breathing and the existence of several mechanical interactions within the respiratory system combine to render spirometric output fairly insensitive to most potential errors in our assumptions.},

Standardized spirometric measurements were obtained using a common protocol in 34 centres in 14 countries. For each prediction equation, the prediction deviations (i.e. observed minus predicted value) for forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were examined for the whole study population and for each centre. For the age range included, the errors about the ECSC equations showed the most prominent underestimation of both predicted FVC (+355 and +360 mL on average in males and females, respectively) and predicted FEV1 (+211 and +200 mL, respectively) among the five studies examined. As expected, FVC and FEV1 in active smokers from the ECRHS were significantly lower than in lifetime nonsmokers (each p<0.01). We conclude that the present European recommendations on lung function reference values should be reconsidered, but further data for nonsymptomatic subjects above the age of 44 yrs are needed.},

abstract ={To characterize the in vivo force-length relation of the human diaphragm, we related pressures during static inspiratory efforts (Pmus and Pdi, respiratory muscle and transdiaphragmatic pressures, respectively) to diaphragm lengths measured on chest X rays from 22 normal subjects. At total lung capacity, the intersection of diaphragm and chest wall contours corresponds to the anatomic junction of diaphragm and chest wall. This point is located by skeletal landmarks to reveal the entire diaphragm contour on films taken at lower lung volumes. To validate the X-ray measurements, corresponding diameters were measured on 32 normal diaphragms at necropsy. After correction for height and diaphragm position, in vivo and necropsy length estimates along the coronal section agreed within 9%. The diaphragm length-lung volume relation is curvilinear, with length increasing primarily in the portion of the diaphragm apposed to the chest wall. As length increases, Pmus and Pdi rise sharply then plateau, generally conforming to force-length behavior of isolated muscle. However, absence of a Pdi peak at presumed diaphragm resting length suggests that Pdi is submaximal during voluntary inspiratory effort.},

abstract ={Diaphragmatic force-length behavior was assessed in anesthetized dogs using two techniques. One employed measurements in a diaphragm strip with intact nerve and blood supply; the second related transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) to direct estimates of diaphragmatic tension from strain gauge archesduring bilateral, tetanic, supramaximal phrenic nerve stimulation. In strippreparations the diaphragm exerted active force at lengths as short as 40% of resting in situ length (Lo), and maximal force was registered at a length averaging 25% greater than Lo. This suggested a broader effective length range for the diaphragm as compared to other skeletal muscles. In the intact preparation both Pdi and directly measured diaphragmatic tension were inversely related to lung volume and when they were used to calculate the diaphragm's effective radius of curvature (r), r was found to change little or decrease at large lung volumes rather than increase as theory wouldpredict. These findings suggest that length tension characteristics outweighgeometric considerations in explaining the diaphragm's function in normal dogs and probably normal men.},

abstract ={We performed transcutaneous bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at varying lung volumes between residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC) in six normal male volunteers. Peak twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure declined from 49.1 +/- 9.1 (SD) cmH2O at RV to 19.6 +/- 5.97 (SD) cmH2O at TLC. Twitch contraction time fell from 91.8 +/- 11.3 (SD) ms at RV to 57.7 +/- 7.4 (SD) ms at TLC. There was a good correlation between changes in contraction time and transdiaphragmatic pressure (r = 0.7). The fall in transdiaphragmatic pressure was almost all due to a fall in pleural pressure, with little change in gastric pressure between RV and TLC. At TLC the pleural pressure in response to phrenic nerve stimulation was -0.58 cmH2O. We conclude that, as lung volume increases and the diaphragm shortens, it becomes less effective as a pressure generator and that pressure it generates is less well converted into useful inspiratory pressure. At a lung volume close to TLC, the diaphragm ceases to act as an inspiratory muscle.},

abstract ={We determined the static, isometric relationship between diaphragmatic EMG (Edi) and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) in man at specified abdominothoracic configurations, assessed with magnetometers. During inspiratory airflow, measurements of Edi and Pdi were taken as the respiratory system passed through the same configuration as obtained during the static isometric contractions, allowing a comparison of static and dynamic contractions of the diaphragm at a given length and curvature. When voluntary inspiratory maneuvers are performed with no associated outward displacement of the abdominal wall, or with slight inward displacement, the Pdi developed dynamically is the same as that developed statically at a given Edi. When outward movement of the abdominal wall occurs during inspiratory airflow, the Pdi developed dynamically depends on the rate of abdominal displacement, not on overall inspiratory airflow rate. We conclude that the velocity of shortening of the diaphragm increases directly as the rate of abdominal displacement. We construct a pressure-flow analogue of the force-velocity relationship for the diaphragm and discuss the functional implications of these observations in relation to spontaneous breathing.},

abstract ={The purpose of this study was to determine whether the maximum shortening velocity (V
max) in Hill’s mechanical model (A. V. Hill. Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B. 126: 136–195, 1938) should be scaled with activation, measured as a fraction of the maximum isometric force (Fmax). By using the quick-release method, force-velocity (F-V) relationships of the wrist flexors were gathered at five different activation levels (20–100% of maximum at intervals of 20%) from four subjects. The F-V data at different activation levels can be fitted remarkably well with Hill’s characteristic equation. In general, the shortening velocity decreases with activation. With the assumption of nonlinear relationships between Hill constants and activation level, a scaledV
max model was developed. When the F-V curves for submaximal activation were forced to converge at theV
max obtained with maximum activation (constantV
max model), there were drastic changes in the shape of the curves. The differences in V
max values generated by the scaled and constantV
max models were statistically significant. These results suggest that, when a Hill-type model is used in musculoskeletal modeling, theV
max should be scaled with activation.},

number = {6}, 
pages = {1087-1092}, 
year = {1960}, 
abstract ={The abdominal (gastric) pressures as well as the intrathoracic pressures were recorded in man during various respiratory maneuvers such as complete relaxation, moderate inspiratory and expiratory efforts, maximal inspiratory and expiratory efforts, and during maximal abdominal pressure efforts. Each maneuver was systematically carried out at various lung volumes. From these measurements it is possible to determine the transdiaphragmatic pressure difference and thus obtain information concerning the activity of the diaphragm during these various maneuvers. During relaxation pressure maneuvers and during moderate expiratory pressure efforts the transdiaphragmatic pressure difference is zero. During maximal inspiratory efforts the pressure is about 100 cm H2O more positive on the abdominal side than on the thoracic side of the diaphragm regardless of the lung volume. A similar difference is found during a maximal abdominal contraction whether during this maneuver the alveolar pressure is zero or whether a high alveolar expiratory pressure is developed. These findings are discussed in terms of reflex contractions of the diaphragm which limit the pressures and volumes that can be obtained in the lung.Submitted on May 2, 1960},

abstract ={Chronic ethanol consumption alters the structure and function of human respiratory muscle. We have examined its effect on the active and passive mechanical properties of rat diaphragm strips in vitro. We conditioned eight rats using a liquid diet containing ethanol as 36% of calories. Eight control rats were pair-fed an isocaloric, ethanol-free liquid diet. Rats were killed after 23 wk. Two strips from the left hemidiaphragm were suspended in Krebs-Ringers solution at 25 degrees C, equilibrated with 5% CO2–95% O2. Isometric stresses were calculated from force transducer measurements. Strips were stimulated directly at supramaximal voltage. Twitch stress (Pt), measured at optimal length (Lo), was greater in ethanol-conditioned strips: 5.1 vs. 3.8 N/cm2. Times to peak Pt and twitch half-relaxation times were equal. Tetanic stress at Lo (Po) was also greater after ethanol conditioning: 17.2 vs. 12.8 N/cm2. Pt/Po ratios were equal. Expressed as %Po, tetanic stress-stimulation frequency curves and tetanic stress-length curves were identical. Ethanol-conditioned strips were marginally less compliant when passively stretched to lengths between Lo and 130% Lo. We postulate that ethanol may have increased active stress development by reducing intracellular free water.},

abstract ={Thoracoabdominal configuration, intrathoracic (esophageal), intra-abdominal (gastric), and transdiaphragmatic pressures were studied in six normal upright subjects during relaxed (RVC) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Chest wall configuration showed substantial departure from its relaxation characteristics during FVC. Paradoxical (outward) movement was recorded for a low lateral diameter of the rib cage (on the costal margin) at high volume during RVC and during most of FVC, while the other rib cage dimensions were decreasing. Transdiaphragmatic pressure was positive during most of the FVC, particularly toward RV, reflecting active contraction of the diaphragm. We conclude that diaphragmatic activity modulates forced expiration and that the chest wall may influence the FVC maneuver.},

pages = {756-760}, 
year = {1982}, 
abstract ={Displacements of the rib cage are determined by the intrinsic passive properties of the rib cage, rib cage musculature, pleural and abdominal pressures, and the diaphragm. The diaphragm's mechanical actions on the rib cage are inferred from a force-balance analysis in which the diaphragm is seen to cause expansion of the rib cage by pulling cephalad at its insertions on the lower ribs (insertional component) and by raising intra-abdominal pressure, which pushes outward on the diaphragm's zone of apposition to the rib cage (appositional component). Goldman and Mead suggested that the diaphragm, acting alone, could drive both the rib cage and abdomen on their passive characteristics. The force-balance analysis shows that the diaphragm's inspiratory action on the rib cage is less than predicted by Goldman and Mead, but that in the special circumstances of their experiment (low lung volumes), the appositional component is large and the rib cage can be driven close to its passive characteristics. The force-balance analysis is consistent with recent observations by other investigations and is incompatible with the model proposed by Macklem and colleagues and with the Goldman-Mead hypothesis. Experiments on three subjects produced data consistent with the force-balance analysis, showing that the inspiratory action of the diaphragm on the rib cage is greatest at low lung volumes.},

volume = {58},

pages = {1997-2003}, 
year = {1985}, 
abstract ={We develop a theory to predict the partitioning of a change in volume of the abdominal contents into the end-expiratory volume changes of the lung, rib cage, and anterior abdominal wall. First, we calculate the distribution of such a volume change using the relative compliances of the three compartments. We then consider the inspiratory influence of abdominal pressure on the rib cage and its effect on the distribution of this volume. We test our theory by inducing gastric distension in three experienced laboratory personnel. We instilled and subsequently withdrew 1 liter of water from a gastric balloon and examined the effects of this change in gastric volume on the relaxation characteristics of the respiratory system. The distribution of the volume change that would be expected from the observed relative compliances of the three compartments would be approximately 66% into change in lung volume, 25% into change in rib cage volume, and 9% into change in abdominal volume. Instead, in line with our predictions for acute gastric distension, approximately 33% went into decrease in lung volume, 40% into increase in rib cage volume, and 26% into increase in abdominal volume. These results suggest that the interactions among the rib cage, abdomen, and diaphragm are such as to defend against large changes in end-expiratory lung volume in the face of abdominal distension.},

abstract ={We measured abdominal compliance (Cab) and rib cage displacement (delta Vrc) relative to abdominal displacement (delta Vab) during relaxation and tidal breathing in upright (U) and supine (S) postures in five normal subjects. In S, an abdominal binder was used to decrease Cab in two to five increments. We also measured the electrical activity of the parasternal muscle (EMGps) with the use of fine-wire intramuscular electrodes during CO2 rebreathing in U and in supine unbound (SU) and supine bound (SB) postures. During maximum binding (SB2), Cab decreased to 39 +/- 7% of the SU value (P = 0.01), matching Cab in U (P = 0.16). In the SB condition, the ratio of tidal delta Vrc/delta Vab to relaxation delta Vrc/delta Vab increased as Cab decreased, matching the data in U. For the group, this ratio decreased during SU to 47 +/- 10% (P = 0.02) but increased during SB2 to 86 +/- 7% (P = 0.18) of the value in U. During CO2 rebreathing, EMGps increased linearly with tidal volume (r > 0.727, P < 0.01). However, at any given tidal volume, the SU and SB2 EMGps were not significantly different (P = 0.12), and both were less than that in U (P < 0.02). The results suggest that the differences in chest wall motion between U and S may be due to the difference in Cab and not to different patterns of respiratory muscle recruitment. The mechanism may relate to changes in mechanical coupling between the diaphragm and the rib cage.},

ABSTRACT={Detecting the excess of spike synchrony and testing its significance can not be done analytically in many types of spike trains and relies on adequate surrogate methods. The main challenge for these methods is to conserve certain features of the spike trains, the two most important being the firing rate and the inter-spike interval statistics. In this study we make use of operational time to introduce generalizations to spike dithering and propose two novel surrogate methods which conserve both features with high accuracy. Compared to earlier approaches, the methods show an improved robustness in detecting excess synchrony between spike trains}
