Changes for usfsim -  Fri Aug 31 2018
=====================================
 The usfsim package is an upgrade of the USF simulator package. The Motif-based
 user interface has been replaced with the Qt framework. The workflow
 has also been completely overhauled. Some rarely used features of the
 simulator package have been removed.
 
 There are three main programs:

   simbuild:   Used for creating and editing models. It has a child
               window, simlaunch, used to start and manage the
               simulation.  This could be a fourth standalone program,
               but it couples so strongly with its simbuild parent
               that it makes more sense to have it be a child window.

   simrun:     This is the simulation engine. It has no user interface.
               The inputs are from files produced by simbuild and also
               by commands sent directly to it from simbuild using a
               network interface (sockets). The simrun program can
               produce a .bdt file and/or a set of wave files that can
               be used to plot the results of the simulation.

   simviewer:  This program plots the results of the simulation. The
               selection of what to plot are made in the simlaunch
               window.


PSR or other external objects
=============================

A "PSR" type cell in the simulator has an output firing rate that is
proportional to the input firing rate, but with some delay when firing
starts, and a different delay when it stops.  The output firing rate
ramps up exponentially after the input starts, with a time constant
called (in newsned) Rise Time.  The output firing rate dies off
exponentially after input firing stops, with a time constant called
(in newsned) Fall Time.  

The output firing pattern is random.  The output firing rate is
represented inside the simulator as a probability of firing at each
time step.  It is this value that rises and falls exponentially
depending on the input firing rate.  

The user can also specify an Output Threshold parameter, which is an
amount by which to reduce what would otherwise have been the
probability of firing at each time step.  If the difference is
negative, the cell does not fire.

To specify a PSR type cell population in newsned, select a PSR cell
type in the Cell Parameter page.  The Rise Time and Fall Time are in
milliseconds, and the Output Threshold is an offset to the probability
of firing at each time step.

When making connections to a PSR population, a Synapse Strength of 1
will result in a steady state output firing rate equal to the input
firing rate, and the output firing rate contribution of this
connection is proportional to the strength parameter.

The Synapse Equilibrium Potential has no effect on the PSR cell.
A long Synapse Time Constant will tend to smooth out the effect of the
incoming spikes.

Hybrid I/F (burster) cell
=========================

A Hybrid I/F (burster) cell in the simulator is an implementation of
the model in B. Breen, W. C. Gerken, and R. J. Butera. "Hybrid
Integrate-and-Fire model of a bursting neuron." Neural
Computation. (2003) 15:2843-2862.

To specify a burster cell population in newsned, select the Burster
cell type in the Cell parameter page.  The Applied Current (Iapp)
parameter is in picoamps, and is the same as the parameter by the same
name in the paper.

In the absence of synaptic input, with Iapp set to 15, the cell emits
bursts of spikes at an interval of about 4 seconds.  Iapp = 20 gives 2
seconds.  Iapp = 0 results in no spikes, and Iapp = 25 results in
tonic firing.

The cell can also be made to fire with synaptic input, but the
bursting pattern will be obscured by the randomness of the input.

Other recent changes
====================

	./configure; make; make install

and you should be able to run simbuild, simrun, or simviewer regardless of
what directory you are in.  You might need to have admin privileges on
your system to run the "make install" part.

In newnsed's Synapse Selection Panel, you can now specify a minimum
conduction time as well as a maximum.  The actual times will be
uniformly distributed between the two.

Plotting state variables other than Vm
======================================

For Hybrid IF cells (which use absolute membrane potentials rather
than relative to resting potential), the plotted Vm and threshold
values are offset by 50mV so that they will line up with the MacGregor
membrane potentials.

For Hybrid IF cells, the gating variable "h" is plotted, and for
MacGregor cells, the potassium conductance is plotted.

The value of "h" can vary from 0 to 1, which will correspond to -30mV
to +30mV on the plot.

The potassium conductance is a non-negative number.  0 will be plotted
at -20mV with a scale of 10mV for each unit of potassium conductance.
