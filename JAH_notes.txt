JAH:
-- configure does not seem to respect the CPPFLAGS environment variable or --includedir directive, so I had to manually change the muparser include dir to /home/hayesjohn/src/muparser_v2_2_3/include in my Makefile on the following line:
   sim_CPPFLAGS = $(DEBUG_OR_NOT) -I/usr/include/muParser
to:
   sim_CPPFLAGS = $(DEBUG_OR_NOT) -I/home/hayesjohn/src/muparser_v2_2_3/include

-- configure/Makefile DOES seem to respect the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to link the muParser library in with the following defined in .basrc:
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/hayesjohn/src/muparser_v2_2_3/lib/
